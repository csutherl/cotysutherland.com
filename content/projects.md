Most of the projects that I work on are Open Source projects. I'm really lucky to have a job that allows me to work within those communities as well. I've listed a handful of the projects I most actively work on below. In addition to those, I've also contributed to several other projects like [JBoss Web](https://jbossweb.jboss.org), [mod_cluster](https://modcluster.io), [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org) (aka apache or httpd), and [OpenSSL](https://openssl.org).

##### Apache Tomcat

Apache Tomcat is an open source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language, and Java WebSocket specifications. I have been a committer on the project since 2016, and on the Project Management Committee since 2017. I am a member of the Tomcat Security team as well.

*Lanuages:* Java and C (tomcat-native and mod_jk components)

##### Embedded Tomcat Quickstarts

Use of Embedded Tomcat has grown quite in recent years, but our documentation doesn't have a lot of examples of how to use it. I created this project as a place to store "quickstarts" for Embedded Tomcat for users to have a quick and easy to reference to see how to use it. In the project I included a vanilla tomcat implementation and a Spring Boot implementation of the examples.

##### Vault Extension for Apache Tomcat

The tomcat-vault library is a PicketLink vault extension for Apache Tomcat. It allows you to place sensitive information, such as passwords, inside of a vault instead of the Tomcat configuration files. This is one of the components that is used by the product I maintain and so I was pretty active fixing things in this project.

#### Fedora Package Maintainer

I've been a package maintainer for the tomcat package on Fedora since 2015, and a co-maintainer for the tomcat-native package since 2016. These packages are wrappers for the Apache Tomcat releases with a few additional things (like systemd service units) to make them accessible by system administrators through the operating system's package manager.

##### Jacobs for Board of Education

I created a website using Hugo for the Pamela Young-Jacobs for Columbus County Board of Education campaign.
