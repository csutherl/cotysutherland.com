Hi! I've been wanting to write this post ever since we got home from Miami and finally carved out some time to do so. In short, my first ApacheCon experience was fantastic and I'd love to go again.

Before I get started talking about the awesome experience that I had, I wanted to say that this is only the second conference that I've attended in my professional career so I don't really have a good benchmark for conference ratings. I have been working at Red Hat with Apache Tomcat and httpd for almost six years now, but never had the opportunity to go to an ApacheCon until this year.  This was also the first conference that I've been a speaker at, so I was extremely nervous and wasn't really sure what to expect. Luckily for me my talk was on the third day, so I had plenty of time to get to know the other committers and get comfortable in the room.

In addition to this being my first year at ApacheCon, we also had the first TomcatCon! This was really interesting to me because I got to know the Tomcat users at the conference.

My wife (she tagged along for vacation in Florida after the conference) and I arrived around 8 PM Monday night at the hotel. I'd already given friends a heads up on when we'd get there so we checked in and immediately returned to the lobby to meet them. We had dinner with one friend that I knew and a few committers that I was introduced to. Dinner was fun experience because I got to know the other committers personally before talking about Tomcat things. We went to a little place for dinner in the food court near the hotel and ended the night with a few beers in the hotel bar.

The schedule that I followed at the conference can be found [here](https://apachecon2017.sched.com/csutherl), but I attended almost all of the TomcatCon track. The first day of the conference was mostly introduction things, like the starting keynotes and a talk called "State of the Cat" which gave a high level overview of the Tomcat project. After that, there were a few talks on SSL and securing the Tomcat environment. We ended the day with a PGP Signing Party (my first signing too!). dinner again with jf and friends day two, more tomcat talks IoT talk with JF day three, my turn to talk. There's a camera? head to orlando for vacation after overall this conference brought me closer to the other committers and users and helped get me more excited for contributing to my projects

Thanks so much to all involved in making ApacheCon 2017 happen! I'll definitely be back.
