The Neurodiversity group at Red Hat is planning and event for World Mental Health Day this year (October 10, 2019) and I was curious if TNAS was doing something too. The theme of this year is "suicide prevention". Given that our population has the [highest suicide rate among any other racial/ethnic group](https://newsmaven.io/indiancountrytoday/news/centers-for-disease-control-release-suicide-stats-native-american-women-top-the-list-with-139-percent-increase-ivpVozlnc0eKs3iHX44V4Q/) in the US, I would like to take this opportunity to partner with another Diversity and Inclusion community at Red Hat and/or TNAS to bring some attention to this particular statistic. If we don't presently have something planned, would you be interested in partnering with us for an event? Maybe we could get a Native speaker to talk to us about these issues?
