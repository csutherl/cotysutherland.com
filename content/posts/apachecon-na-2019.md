Since I'm a [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) committer and PMC member, I attended the conference to speak about Tomcat. [ApacheCon North America 2019](https://www.apachecon.com/acna2019/index.html) was a four day conference that happened in Las Vegas from September 9th until the 12th. This was my second ApacheCon attendance.

### Day 1

I got started with an early morning walking around to see all the vendor and sponsor tables (that were setup). I got some pretty neat swag, including several t-shirts! I think that my favorite t-shirt was from [DataStax](https://www.datastax.com/) (I also got some socks too!). Lots of shirts, stickers, cool stuff.

Meeting with team members in Europe and hanging with jws pm in bar camp. Lunch with tomcat committers. bar camp, having lots of tomcat conversations because most committers are here. some other things, testing presentation :)

Twister2 high performance data processing by sunpun. On GitHub

Comparison between PM role in proprietary project vs open source project

speaker reception event, met some new folk chatted a bit. felt very welcome even though i wasnt feeling very social.

close the night with dinner at mercato della pescheria. grilled chicken pesto was great.

### Day 2

mark cox - Community over code

Cliff - Httpd started with a very business friendly license

Lars - writing a book about Httpd started his involvement with the Apache group. Contributions come in all shapes and sizes.

Roy - the Apache way. Figuring out how to collaborate in the early days yielded the Apache way. Everyone should govern themselves in the creation of their own projects. One of the keys to success.

Jim - ported software (like Httpd) to apple Unix (aux).  Sense of community and sense of family. Board of directors are leaders and stewards of the Apache way. Get involved and give back.

Brian - differentiating factor between the asf and the rest of the internet is willingness to positively reply to patches, etc. Guild is a nice reference instead of non-profit. Conversations about what sort of software we want to build should be brought up more.

Appreciate others and don't make it about you.

David brin - check out the world of Watson keynote. Emergent AI won't come from the military because they pay attention. It will likely come from the financial industry. Goldman Sachs spend a ton in AI for machine learning, etc. Pyramids is power/privilege. Divide and conquer. We should apply that to AI. Open source needs to ensure AI is egalitarian. Corporations were the first experiment in containing ai systems.

Christopher Ferris (IBM) - it's not about the license. Open governance is most important to IBM.

Johnathan Ellis - Datastax. Cassandra and tinkerpop. Check out datastax academy (free training about graph dbs).

Sam Ruby - state of the feather. Asf president. Same wants newer asf people to work to get on the board and effect change.netbeans is now under the asf! Committee stats.overall status. Bottom up org structure. No one director or PMC member has more say than others. Infra stuff, asf hosts all the code. Document onboarding for new contributors. Tracking and appreciating noncode contributions. D+I newest vp; outreachy. State of diversity in open source.

# tomcatcon

Remy - state of the cat. celebrating 20 years of Tomcat \o/. Sun microsystems donated "tomcat" to the ASF which formed the jakarta project in august 1999 to accept that.

chris - lets encrypt apache tomcat.

coty - (me) finished 20 mins early :( need to add some more interesting stuff maybe something about classloader leaks. and change the perspective to walk thorugh an issue, instead of telling the audience what the problem was ahead of time, walk through the presentation with a hung request and trace it down.

garret wilson - clean urls via custom internet media types on tomcat.

chris - Locking Down Apache Tomcat: Practical Security for Real-world Applications.

Day 3

Keynotes

Samaira - disruptive actions from groups. Committed to teaching every kid in the world to code. Coderbunnyz board game. Coderbunnyz workshops where she's taught hundreds of workshops. #1 on Amazon after she started selling. Around the age of 5 girls begin to lose interest in math and science because of society. Now doing girls only workshops to increase girls in stem. Yes, 1 billion kids can code. Codermindz first AI game. Superpower: the power of failure. A safe place to fail and take risks. Every no is one step closer to a yes. Superpower: x ray vision (experience) and hope. Self care is important. Main learnings: Time expands to accommodate your passions and priorities. Don't work and failure. Worry about missed chances when you don't even try.

James gosling - inventor of java?! Journey to open source. Self taught coder. Viewed coding as a crazy puzzle because not much coding resources. Got the sources to the Pascal compiler and learned from that. From the on to simula, first oo language. Written on cdc 6000 assembler. Fell in love with oo programming. Eventually got to Carnage Mellon University. Godspell was created by a performing arts student, became super popular and the creator became famous..then the univ tried to retroactively change their IP rules to get part ownership of godspell. Couldn't maintain emacs and graduate, so he had to find a maintainer. Spent lots of time trying to prevent people from abusing the kindness of contributions to the work. Eventually made it to sun which was mostly open source which took a long time to convince lawyers it was ok. "Indent" first open source contribution by sun (1985).  Java was a pretty rocky road. Difficult open source aspects. First java release was including sources, bit the licensing was messy. When freedoms collide, we agree to limit our freedoms in exchange for freedom to be safe (need to revisit this). Rules that control bullies often annoy everyone else, the java community process was an attempt to do that. Eventually got to gpl. After applying gpl to java sun open sourced almost everything else (minus Solaris). Solaris was close to being licensed with gpl, but then Oracle bought sun and that stopped. Java survived though! What do I love about Apache: 1) clean license 2) community 3) code of conduct 4) they let him be a committer. Working at AWS, Apache license is the default for their open source projects.

Junping du - chair of tencent open source alliance. Director big data at tencent. Open source in tencent.

i missed the christopher crosbie.

Remy - graal! post recording.

me! - packaging tomcat

Remy recorded all the tomcatcon talks to drop on YouTube.

Day 4

Jay (10 am) - chat bots. Specific use cases/conversations are ok to do, but general conversations are hard.

Hazem Saleh - Apache Cordova - introduction.

Jim - Httpd reverse proxy talk.

Lars - a beginners guide to https and tls.

jf - final talk about httpd
