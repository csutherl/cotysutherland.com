2. Keep it casual and fun.
3. Identifying problems and solutions
4. Delegate - appoint committees and let volunteers have ownership
5. Show gratitude and “pump tires”
6. recognize member contributions
7. Give shout-outs when jobs are well done.

Relationships between co-chairs is critical

Vent, ask for help, etc

AISES Software Committee??

Single alphabet vs poly-alphabet

Code breakers could break poly-alphabets in the 1800s

1918 first patent on engima design

The one on display in the talk was the real deal. 100,000 built in the 1920s and were commercially available.

Implementation issues, policy issues, insider trading issues.

The engima could produce 3.2x10^104 different combinations

National cryptologic museum exhibit item.

Symmetric encryption

Policy dictated changing settings every day and then settings for each message

Preambles for messages were the downfall

The enigma machine may have been a more closely kept secret than the development of the atomic bomb

Why do i want to become a manager?

* Expand influence?

Manager -> 1st line manager -> 2nd line manager -> sr manager (triangle)

Be visible, present when you can to ensure senior managers are aware of your contributions.

When people come to you and suggest for you to be a manager its because they see leadership qualities in you.

People are your most important assets.

Talk to your people. Find out about them so you can better work with them.

[pros and cons photo]

Its really difficult to give honest feedback to poor performers. You cant just let people slide.

[positive and negative management attitudes photo]

Managers are watching you outside of work. Always be authentic.

Have an open door policy.

Listen to people where they are. Sometimes its about listening and not solving problems.

Managers (maintainers) vs leaders (change agents)

Seven lessons learned

1. Make uninterrupted time to listen
2. Dont micromanage
3. Treat people as individuals
4. Emphasize results, not time
5. Admit mistakes
6. Commit to projects your team can do
7. ???

[image matters pic]

Be sincere and genuine.

**Artificial Intelligence** - 10/12

What does AI do?

Use observed data to find patterns and learn to make inferences about new data.

Common machine learning techniques are prediction and grouping. Generation models.

Computer vision - image processing

Natural language processing - understanding text

Forms of data: image, audio, (unstructured) text

What can AI be used for?

* Large-scale social issues
* Research and engineering
* Etc

AI in health

* Predicting disease outbreak
* Classifying scans or x-rays for diagnosis
* Virtual doctor or nurse
* Robot-assisted surgery
* Dosage measurement and error reduction

Responsible use and ethics

* Embedded bias
* Misuses
* Data privacy

Unexplained AI - trying to figure out why a decision was made is really hard to find to correct bias.
