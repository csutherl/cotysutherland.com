I just wanted to capture some of the observations and documentation that I think are useful for continued exploration of AWS (specifically S3, EMR, and Redshift). Here are some notes broken up by service that I think may aid others in their research…

### Simple Storage Service (S3)

S3 is pretty simple and very easy to use. I don’t think it requires very much in the way of explanation, so here is a link or two to the Amazon documentation.

* [Get Started With Amazon Simple Storage Service – Amazon Simple Storage Service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/GetStartedWithS3.html)

And because I’m partial to Python:

* [An Introduction to boto’s S3 interface — boto v2.24.0](http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/s3_tut.html)

### Elastic Map Reduce (EMR)

General EMR docs:

* [What is Amazon EMR? Amazon Elastic MapReduce](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/emr-what-is-emr.html)
* [Getting Started](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/getting-started/)

### Big Data specific things:

* [Overview – Getting Started with AWS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/emr/getting-started-emr-overview.html)
* [Big Data](http://aws.amazon.com/big-data/)

### Redshift

* [Getting Started with Amazon Redshift – Amazon Redshift](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/getting-started.html)
