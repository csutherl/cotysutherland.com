Did anyone notice the Google Doodle last Saturday? If not, [check it out](https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-the-jingle-dress-dance)! It was pretty awesome of Google to celebrate Native American culture in what seems to be an unsolicited post (there wasn't any noteworthy anniversary/birthday/etc to go along with it). The Doodle story got picked up by [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/15/us/google-doodle-jingle-dress-trnd/index.html) and was also written about on [Indian Country Today](https://newsmaven.io/indiancountrytoday/news/today-s-google-doodle-the-jingle-dress-AryRIziemEC5OiauJD52zg/). Take a look at the links to learn more about the Jingle Dress Dance!
