I've already written about my experience at the ApacheCon here, but I wanted to provide a separate link to my talk since it was recorded. I'm also still pretty excited to have given my first talk about Tomcat at an ApacheCon!

I hope that you enjoy my talk and if there is anything missing or something that you'd like me to talk about specifically, please let me know.
