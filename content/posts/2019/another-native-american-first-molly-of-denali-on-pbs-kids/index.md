I haven't had much time  to write about things lately, but I wanted to point this out :D

[Alaska Native girl leads animated kids TV show in US first](https://www.newsobserver.com/entertainment/celebrities/article232395372.html)

"Molly of Denali" is the nation's first-ever children's series featuring indigenous leads! If you have kids (or are just interested in learning about Alaska Natives), please take a look at the link and tune in to PBS Kids to catch the premiere! There are also some online kids games on the [PBS Kids website](https://pbskids.org/molly) and a [podcast](https://mollyofdenalipodcast.org/) that goes along with the series!
