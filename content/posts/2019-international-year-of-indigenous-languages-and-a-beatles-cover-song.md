January of this year started the International Year of Indigenous Languages (IYIL). This project started back in 2016 when the [United Nations General Assembly proclaimed that 2019 would be the International Year of Indigenous Languages](https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/2019/01/2019-international-year-of-indigenous-languages/). The project's [website](https://en.iyil2019.org/) has a lot of good information, so please check it out!

I bring this up now (halfway through the year) because earlier this year, a [Mi'kmaq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi%EA%9E%8Ckmaq) girl named Emma Stevens [sang a cover of the Beatles' song "Black Bird"](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/blog/cape-breton-student-sings-beautiful-mi-kmaq-rendition-of-the-beatles-blackbird-watch-1.5118570) in her Native language (Mi'kmaq) and it went viral. Thousands of people tagged Paul McCartney online and he finally responded!

McCartney was quoted in [cbc.ca](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/blog/mi-kmaq-blackbird-singer-gets-huge-shoutout-from-paul-mccartney-1.5160070) saying that her version is "really cool":

> "There's an incredible version done by a Canadian girl. You see it on YouTube. It's in her native language," McCartney said in a video from a tour stop in Lexington, Ky. "It's really cool, check it out."

In the quote he did erroneously label Mi'kmaq as being a "Native American" tribe when in fact they are First Nations (Canada), but the shout out was impactful just the same. If you're curious about that distinction, let me know :)

Emma Stevens was also in an international spotlight (noted in the same [cbc.ca](http://cbc.ca/) article linked above) at the UN-Habitat Assembly in Nairobi, where she spoke about the Red Dress Movement in Canada, which honors [missing and murdered Indigenous women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_and_murdered_Indigenous_women), and sang a Mi'kmaq Honor Song.

I encourage everyone to check out Emma's song (and others on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClFhsoUwyIVaKC0nlRkBnzw))!

Does anyone else know of any interesting projects dealing with Indigenous languages that are happening this year?
