# Projects

Most of my work centers around **open source projects** and Iâ€™m fortunate to have a role that lets me contribute directly to those communities as part of my day job. Below are a few of the projects I actively work on or maintain. Iâ€™ve also contributed to others over the years, including **JBoss Web**, **mod_cluster**, **Apache HTTP Server (httpd)**, and **OpenSSL**.

I also enjoy being a webmaster as a hobby and maintain a few sites for nonprofit organizations.

Iâ€™ve maintained the **Tomcat package for Fedora** since 2015 and co-maintain the **tomcat-native** package as well. These packages adapt upstream releases for system administrators by adding packaging logic, systemd integration, and platform-specific patches.

The Vault Extension for Apache Tomcat library is a **PicketLink Vault** extension that lets you store sensitive information (like passwords) outside of Tomcat configuration files. This component is used in the product I support at Red Hat, so Iâ€™ve contributed actively to maintaining and improving it.

- **Languages:** Java
