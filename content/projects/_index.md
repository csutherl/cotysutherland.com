# Projects

Most of my work centers around **open source projects** and Iâ€™m fortunate to have a role that lets me contribute directly to those communities as part of my day job. Below are a few of the projects I actively work on or maintain. Iâ€™ve also contributed to others over the years, including **JBoss Web**, **mod_cluster**, **Apache HTTP Server (httpd)**, and **OpenSSL**.

I also enjoy being a webmaster as a hobby and maintain a few sites for nonprofit organizations.

[Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org) is an open source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language, and Java WebSocket specifications. Iâ€™ve been a **committer since 2016**, a **Project Management Committee (PMC) member since 2017**, and am part of the **Tomcat Security Team**.

As the use of **Embedded Tomcat** has grown, I noticed a gap in the available reference material. I created this project to offer quickstart examples showing how to use Embedded Tomcat â€” including both a **vanilla** implementation and a **Spring Boot** version.

## Vault Extension for Apache Tomcat

[![Source on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/source-github-blue)](https://github.com/web-servers/tomcat-vault)

The `tomcat-vault` library is a **PicketLink Vault** extension that lets you store sensitive information (like passwords) outside of Tomcat configuration files. This component is used in the product I support at Red Hat, so Iâ€™ve contributed actively to maintaining and improving it.
