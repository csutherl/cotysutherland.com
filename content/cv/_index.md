# Professional Summary

I'm a software engineering leader who thrives at the intersection of technology, people, and community. I dive into complex problems, especially when others say "itâ€™s too complicated" or "it canâ€™t be done." Whether it's wrangling legacy systems, shaping open source strategy, or leading distributed engineering teams, I show up with patience, persistence, and a belief that good systems and good people grow together.

Once Iâ€™ve figured something out, I share it through mentoring, documentation, blog posts, or talks. Iâ€™ve contributed to projects like Apache Tomcat and the Fedora Project, and Iâ€™m passionate about building systems that people can trust, support, and improve without burning out.

## Skills

- **Software Engineering:** Deep experience with Java (especially Apache Tomcat), Python tooling, shell scripting, and CI/CD workflows using Jenkins, GitHub, and GitLab.
- **Systems Engineering:** Maintainer of the tomcat package in Fedora, with experience packaging and maintaining secure and stable system components.
- **Open Source Leadership:** Apache Tomcat PMC member, ASF member, and long-time Fedora Project contributor. I also participate in the Fedora DEI Team. 
- **Mentorship & Community Building:** Former ERG founder and leader for over six years; active mentor and advocate for open source contributors and early-career engineers.
- **Technical Leadership:** Currently manage a remote team of 12 Software and Software Quality Engineers at Red Hat working on Middleware, delivering enterprise-grade software products based on open source projects.
- **Writing & Communication:** Strong focus on clear, actionable documentation and strategic technical storytelling.

## Work Experience

### Red Hat (2011â€“present)
I'm currently working as a Senior Manager, Software Engineering supporting two products in the Middleware portfolio.

In my long tenure at Red Hat, I've filled various roles across Engineering (as an IC and People Manager), Customer Experience and Engagement (where I started my career at Red Hat), and IT (Business Intelligence).

### Apache Software Foundation (2016â€“present)
As a member of the Apache Tomcat community, I participate as a committer and PMC Member. I'm also an Apache Software Foundation member.

### Fedora Project (2015â€“present)
At this point I'm mostly just overseeing the Fedora Project packages that we care about: tomcat, tomcat-native, mod_proxy_cluster, etc. I've encouraged others to take on a role of co-maintainer and watched them grow over the years to the point that I'm not really needed that much.

### Various Nonprofit Boards (2018â€“present)
Over the years, I've worked with a number of American Indian nonprofit organizations and served as Vice President for the Triangle Native American Society and Secretary for Natives in Tech for several years.
