I am a Software Engineer with over ten years of experience, and I love what I do. I also love volunteering my time, talent, and treasures to several different nonprofit organizations. I recently discovered that I also enjoy managing teams, so I'm giving that a shot as a Software Engineering Manager at Red Hat.
