I am a Software Engineer with over ten years of experience, and I love what I do. Volunteering my time, talent, and treasures to nonprofit organizations is another thing I love to do. I recently discovered that I enjoy taking a more active leadership role, so I'm giving that a shot as a Software Engineering Manager at Red Hat.
