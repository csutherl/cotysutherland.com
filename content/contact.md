Thanks for visiting! I'm always open to thoughtful conversations around open source, software leadership, and the intersection of technology and community.

If you're looking for someone with deep experience in open-source infrastructure, Java application servers, or engineering team development, Iâ€™m open to opportunities such as:

* Advisory roles or board service (especially with mission-driven or technical organizations)
* Mentorship for early-career engineers and new engineering managers
* Collaborations on open source or AI-related projects

Feel free to connect with me via LinkedIn, or reach out directly using the form below.
