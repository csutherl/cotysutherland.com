### Who Am I?

Hi! I’m Coty, a member of the [Waccamaw Siouan Tribe of North Carolina](https://waccamaw-siouan.org/) and Senior Software Engineer/Software Engineering Manager currently employed by [Red Hat, Inc](https://www.redhat.com/). I live in central North Carolina with my wife, three sons, and several pets.

### What Do I Do?

The main project that I contribute to these days is [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) where I’m a committer and Project Management Committee (PMC) member. I also contribute to [Apache HTTP Server (httpd)](https://httpd.apache.org/) and [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/), but not as often. Another project I frequently work on is RPM packaging of tomcat (and sometimes httpd, some httpd modules, and openssl) for the [Fedora Project](https://fedoraproject.org/) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Most of my software contributions to Open Source projects are under the username ‘csutherl’, check me out on the web!
